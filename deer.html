                        <p>
                            The deer family has a very wide distribution, starting from the North Pole in the Old World.
                            They live all the way to the northwest of Africa in the south, and everywhere in the North and South continents in the New World. The deer family known so far is divided into 2 subfamilies, 1 genus and 4 subspecies in the Musk deer family, and 14 genera and 184 species and subspecies in the deer family.

                    <h3>Characteristic</h3>
                    <p>                        
                        There are various body sizes, large, medium, and small, with the largest being as large as a horse (continental deer).
                        The smallest is an elk the size of a large dog. Horns are usually only possessed by males and sometimes not by both males and females.
                        The horn is formed from the cheekbone [額骨] and is branching and decidual at the same time from the bony mass (骨質中實).

                    <h3>Life</h3>
                    <p>
                        They like social life and sometimes form groups in winter. In spring, when the warm season approaches, they disband, and the males lead a solitary life until the next winter, but the mother and young cubs live in groups as they are. The mating season is between early September and early October, and one young is born around May or June.

                        Deer antlers are called deer antlers and are treated as valuable herbal medicines.
                        Antler refers to newly sprouted deer antlers, which have many blood vessels and are covered with soft fine hairs. Bone is usually composed of calcareous and collagen. The flexible horns gradually harden over May and June, the blood vessels decrease, and the soft fine hairs disappear, eventually becoming hard keratin. The horny horns fall off in the spring of the following year, and new ones appear.<br>
