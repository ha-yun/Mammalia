                        <p>
                            It is a practical animal that is kept as a pet and catches mice.
                            The word “myo” (猫), meaning cat, is derived from the word “myo” (貓).
                            Male and female cats are also called nang-myo (郎猫), female cat (female cat), checkered tabby cat (flower cat), and black cat (豹花猫).

                    <h3>Origin</h3>
                    <p>  
                        It is said that about 5,000 years ago, wild cats from Libya, Africa, were domesticated and bred by ancient Egyptians and gradually spread to all parts of the world.
                        It is estimated that they were introduced to Korea in the course of visiting China before the 10th century.

                    <h3>Characteristic</h3>
                    <p>
                        They vary in body length from 47 to 51 cm, tail length from 22 to 38 cm, and weight from 2 to 8.5 kg. It has five toes on its front feet, four toes on its hind feet, and sharp claws at the tips of each toe. The soles of the front and hind feet have soft flesh sacs and are covered with hair, so they can walk without making a sound and hide their claws. Its hind legs are relatively long, so it is strong enough to run.
                        The developed vision makes it convenient for activities at night, and it can quickly identify the image of an object that catches the eye even when it appears to be dozing. The long hairs on the face, around the mouth, under the chin, on the upper lip, above the eyes, and on the cheeks are convenient for catching mice, etc. because they are sensitive to touch.
                        It has a well-developed sense of smell, and the tip of the tongue has a sharp, thorn-like protrusion that is tilted back, making it suitable for licking meat attached to bones. And the sharp teeth for biting meat and the muscles that pull the lower jaw have been developed to be suitable for meat eating.

                    <h3>Life</h3>
                    <p>
                        They do not live in groups, have a habit of walking around looking for food, and when they catch a mouse, they don't eat it right away, and they play cruelly for a long time.
                        They can swim, but generally do not like to go into the water. The gestation period is about 65 days, and 4 to 6 young are born at a time.
                        The lifespan of 20 years is the longest among pets. Other than pets, they are kept for the purpose of catching mice.
                        In particular, when an epidemic that uses mice as an intermediary, such as plague, is prevalent, there are many benefits in areas where silkworms are raised.<br>
